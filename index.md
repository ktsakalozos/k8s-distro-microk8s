## Why should I read this?

There is (too) much information on how to interact and use a Kubernetes cluster but there is almost none on how to setup one from ground up.
This project tries to close this gap. In understanding what a Kubernetes cluster is and how it works you will gain greater understanding on the following:
- Why K8s works the way it does.
- How to use k8s.
- When to opt for a distribution vs setting up your own.
